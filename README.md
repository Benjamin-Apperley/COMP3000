# COMP3000

Speeding up commonly used loop kernels using Openmp, Vectorization and Loop Tiling.

Project Supervisor: Vasilios Kelefouras

Project Vision
This project will be a task of attempting to speed up commonly used loop kernels and comparing how much specific optimization techniques speed up an application.
Initially, only the CPU in my laptop will be used to run the kernels but later in development, if i am able to, other devices will be used to compare speeds. If i have time, I will also attempt to optimize using GPUs available on university computers.
